# **Transport Services Available to Applications 🚀**

## 📌 Overview

A **socket** serves as the interface between an application process and the **transport-layer protocol**. When an application sends a message, it passes through the socket. The transport-layer protocol is responsible for delivering this message to the receiving process's socket. Many networks, including the **Internet**, provide multiple transport-layer protocols.

When developing an application, you must select an appropriate **transport-layer protocol** based on the services it provides. This decision is analogous to choosing between a **train** or an **airplane** for travel between two cities—each mode of transport offers different services. For instance:

- 🚆 **Train:** Offers **downtown pickup and drop-off**
- ✈️ **Airplane:** Provides **shorter travel times**

Similarly, transport-layer protocols provide different services tailored to specific needs.

## 🔍 Key Transport-Layer Services

Transport-layer services can be classified into four broad dimensions:

1. **✅ Reliable Data Transfer** – Ensures that data is delivered correctly and in order.
2. **📈 Throughput** – Determines the amount of data successfully delivered per unit time.
3. **⏳ Timing** – Guarantees specific delays or ensures timely delivery.
4. **🔒 Security** – Provides encryption and data integrity mechanisms.
