## 🔍 Studying Network Applications
In this section, we explore the **conceptual and implementation aspects** of network applications:

### 📑 Key Application-Layer Concepts
- **Network Services** required by applications
- **Client-Server Model** and communication between processes
- **Transport-Layer Interfaces**

### 🌍 In-Depth Study of Network Applications
- 🌐 **Web** - Browsing and accessing information
- 📧 **E-mail** - Message transfer and protocols
- 📡 **DNS (Domain Name System)** - Resolving domain names to IPs
- 🔄 **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Distribution** - Decentralized file sharing
- 📺 **Video Streaming** - On-demand content delivery

### 🖥 Network Application Development
We examine how network applications are developed using **TCP** and **UDP**, specifically:
- 🛠 **Socket Interface**
- 🔄 **Client-Server Communication**
- 🐍 **Python Programming** for networking
- 🎯 **Hands-on Socket Programming Assignments**

## 📌 Why Start with the Application Layer?
The **application layer** is the most familiar to us because we interact with its services daily. By studying application layer protocols, we:
- Gain a **strong foundation** in networking concepts
- Understand the **challenges** in protocol design
- Prepare for deeper studies in **transport, network, and link layer protocols**
