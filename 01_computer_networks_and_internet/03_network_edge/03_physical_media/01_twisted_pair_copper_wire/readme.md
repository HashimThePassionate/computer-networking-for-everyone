# 🌐 **Twisted-Pair Copper Wire**

## 🖥️ **Introduction**
**Twisted-pair copper wire** is the most inexpensive and widely used **guided transmission medium**. For over a century, it has been the backbone of telephone networks, connecting telephones to local telephone switches. Despite the emergence of advanced technologies like **fiber optics**, twisted-pair copper wire continues to dominate **high-speed LAN networking** due to its reliability, cost-effectiveness, and technological advancements.

## 📌 **What Is Twisted-Pair Copper Wire?**

### 🌟 **Structure**:
1. **Composition**:  
   - Two **insulated copper wires**, each about **1 mm thick**.  
   - Wires are twisted into a **spiral pattern** to minimize electrical interference.  

2. **Bundling**:  
   - Multiple twisted pairs are grouped together in a cable and covered with a **protective shield**.  

3. **Communication Link**:  
   - A single twisted pair forms one **communication link**.  

## 📊 **Types of Twisted-Pair Copper Wire**

### 1. **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)**:
- Commonly used in **LANs (Local Area Networks)** within buildings.  
- Example: Ethernet networks.  

## 🔧 **Data Rates**
- Twisted pair supports data rates ranging from **10 Mbps** to **10 Gbps**.  
- The achievable speed depends on:  
  - **Wire thickness**.  
  - **Distance** between the transmitter and receiver.
