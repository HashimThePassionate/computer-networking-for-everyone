# 🌐 **Satellite Radio Channels**

## 🖥️ **Introduction**
**Satellite radio channels** use **communication satellites** to link Earth-based **microwave transmitters/receivers** (known as ground stations). Satellites play a vital role in communication systems, especially in remote areas without access to **DSL** or **cable-based Internet**. They operate by receiving signals, amplifying them using repeaters, and transmitting them back to Earth.


## 📌 **What Are Satellite Radio Channels?**

### 🌟 **Definition**:
A **communication satellite** serves as a relay station, receiving, amplifying, and retransmitting signals between ground stations.
