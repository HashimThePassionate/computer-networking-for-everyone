# 🌐 **Understanding the Internet**

## 🤔 **What is the Internet?**
The Internet can be described in two ways:  

1. **🛠️ Nuts and Bolts**:  
   - The Internet is made up of the **hardware** and **software components** that form its foundation.  
   - These include **routers, switches, servers**, and various **protocols** that allow communication between devices.  

2. **🖧 Networking Infrastructure**:  
   - The Internet is a **global network** designed to provide services to **distributed applications** such as email, web browsing, and online gaming.  


## 🔍 **Our Approach**
In this section, we’ll focus on the **public Internet**, a specific network that we’ll use to explore the broader concepts of computer networks and their protocols.  

To better understand the Internet:  
- **We’ll examine its hardware and software (nuts and bolts).**  
- **We’ll study its infrastructure as a service provider for distributed applications.**

### 📊 **Illustration**  
Figure 1.1 will help visualize how the Internet is organized and how its components interact. (Please refer to the corresponding visual representation in your material.)


### **🚀 What's Next?**
We’ll explore:
- The detailed structure and functioning of the Internet.  
- How its components, like protocols and infrastructure, interact to create the seamless connectivity we rely on daily.
