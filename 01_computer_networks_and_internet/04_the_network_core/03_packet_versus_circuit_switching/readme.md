## üß© **Packet Switching: Strengths and Weaknesses**

### üåü **Strengths**:
1. **Efficient Resource Utilization**:
   - Resources are shared dynamically among users, leading to better utilization.
   
2. **Supports Bursty Traffic**:
   - Handles data traffic with unpredictable activity patterns effectively.
   
3. **Scalability**:
   - Can support a large number of users simultaneously.

4. **Lower Costs**:
   - Simpler infrastructure and no resource reservation make it cost-effective.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weaknesses**:
1. **Variable Delays**:
   - Queuing and congestion can introduce unpredictable delays.
   
2. **Less Suitable for Real-Time Applications**:
   - Not ideal for applications requiring consistent performance (e.g., voice calls).

## üß© **Circuit Switching: Strengths and Weaknesses**

### üåü **Strengths**:
1. **Guaranteed Resources**:
   - Ensures consistent performance with dedicated bandwidth.
   
2. **Predictable Latency**:
   - Ideal for real-time applications like voice and video calls.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weaknesses**:
1. **Inefficient Resource Usage**:
   - Resources remain idle during periods of inactivity.

2. **Setup Complexity**:
   - Requires time and effort to establish a connection before communication.

## üñºÔ∏è **Illustrative Examples**

### Example 1: 35 Users Sharing a 1 Mbps Link
- **Scenario**:
  - Each user alternates between activity (100 kbps) and inactivity (90% of the time).
  - Circuit switching reserves 100 kbps for each user.

- **Circuit Switching**:
  - Supports **only 10 users** (1 Mbps / 100 kbps).
  - Wastes bandwidth when users are idle.

- **Packet Switching**:
  - Dynamically shares bandwidth among users.
  - Probability of more than 10 active users is **0.0004** (extremely low).
  - Supports **35 users** while maintaining similar performance.

---

### Example 2: Single Active User with 10 Slots
- **Scenario**:
  - One user generates 1,000 packets of 1,000 bits each.
  - All other users are inactive.

- **Circuit Switching (TDM)**:
  - User can only use **one time slot per frame**.
  - Takes **10 seconds** to transmit all data.

- **Packet Switching**:
  - User can utilize the **entire link bandwidth** (1 Mbps).
  - Takes **1 second** to transmit all data.

## üßÆ **Key Performance Insights**

1. **Resource Efficiency**:
   - Packet switching dynamically allocates link resources, ensuring higher efficiency.
   - Circuit switching pre-allocates resources, leading to underutilization during idle periods.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Packet switching is ideal for bursty, unpredictable traffic patterns.
   - Circuit switching is better for steady, real-time traffic.

## üìä **Current Trends**

1. **Migration to Packet Switching**:
   - Modern telecommunication networks increasingly favor packet switching due to its scalability and efficiency.
   - Even traditional circuit-switched telephone networks now use packet switching for parts of the communication (e.g., international calls).

2. **Real-Time Services Over Packet Networks**:
   - Advancements in **Quality of Service (QoS)** mechanisms enable packet switching to support real-time applications like video conferencing and VoIP.

## üåü **Key Takeaways**

1. **Packet Switching**:
   - Offers higher efficiency and scalability.
   - Suitable for data-heavy, bursty traffic.

2. **Circuit Switching**:
   - Guarantees predictable performance.
   - Ideal for real-time, delay-sensitive applications.

### **Real-World Examples of Packet Switching and Circuit Switching**

## üåê **Real-World Example of Packet Switching**

### **Scenario**: **Internet Browsing**
- When you browse a website, the web page's data (HTML, images, videos, etc.) is broken into small packets.  
- These packets travel independently across the Internet, possibly taking different routes, before reaching your device.  
- Each packet contains header information specifying its destination and sequence to ensure it is reassembled correctly.  

## üìû **2. Real-World Example of Circuit Switching**

### **Scenario**: **Traditional Telephone Call**
- When you make a landline phone call, the telephone network establishes a **dedicated circuit** between your phone and the recipient's phone for the entire duration of the call.  
- Even if you pause during the conversation (e.g., for thinking or listening), the circuit remains reserved and cannot be used by others until the call ends.
