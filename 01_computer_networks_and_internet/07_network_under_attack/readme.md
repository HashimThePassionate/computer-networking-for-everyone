### 🛑 **Types of Network Attacks**

| **Attack Type**                                         | **Description**                                                             | **Impact**                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🦠 **Malware (Viruses, Worms, Trojans)**                | Malicious software that infects devices and spreads                         | Data corruption, system failures, and financial losses |
| 🎭 **Phishing**                                         | Fraudulent emails/websites trick users into revealing sensitive information | Identity theft, financial fraud, data breaches         |
| ⚔️ **Denial of Service (DoS) & Distributed DoS (DDoS)** | Overloading a network service to make it unavailable                        | Website/service downtime, business disruption          |
| 🕵️ **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**                | Attackers intercept communication between users                             | Data theft, session hijacking, eavesdropping           |
| 🔓 **Unauthorized Access & Data Breaches**              | Gaining access to systems without permission                                | Loss of confidential data, financial impact            |
| 🎭 **Spoofing (IP/MAC Address Spoofing)**               | Faking an identity to gain access to networks                               | Network disruption, unauthorized resource use          |

These are just a few of the many possible **cyber threats** that networks face today.
