## 🖥️ **Introduction**
**Coaxial cable** is a widely used **guided transmission medium** that consists of **two concentric copper conductors**, unlike the parallel arrangement in twisted-pair cables. Its unique design, combined with **special insulation and shielding**, allows for **high data transmission rates**. Coaxial cable is commonly utilized in **cable television systems** and **residential Internet access**.

## 📌 **What Is Coaxial Cable?**

### 🌟 **Structure**:
1. **Concentric Conductors**:  
   - Coaxial cable features **two copper conductors**:  
     - An **inner conductor** carries the signal.  
     - An **outer conductor**, or shield, provides insulation and protects against interference.  

2. **Insulation and Shielding**:  
   - The conductors are separated by a **dielectric insulator** and encased in a protective outer jacket, minimizing signal loss and external interference.

## 📊 **Characteristics of Coaxial Cable**

### 1. **High Data Transmission Rates**:
- Coaxial cable can support data rates in the range of **hundreds of Mbps**, making it suitable for modern Internet access.  

### 2. **Shared Medium**:
- Coaxial cable can act as a **shared guided medium**, allowing multiple end systems to connect directly and share the same transmission line.  
- Each end system can **send and receive signals**, and all connected systems can receive the transmitted data.

## 🧩 **Applications of Coaxial Cable**

### 1. **Cable Television Systems**:
- Coaxial cable is the primary medium for **cable TV systems**, transmitting analog or digital signals over specific frequency bands.  

### 2. **Cable Internet Access**:
- Coupled with **cable modems**, coaxial cables provide **broadband Internet access** to residential users.  
- Speeds typically range from **hundreds of Mbps** to even higher with newer technologies.  

### 3. **Shared Communication**:
- Enables multiple devices to communicate by connecting directly to the same cable.

## 📖 **How Coaxial Cable Works**

1. **Signal Transmission**:
   - Digital signals are converted to analog signals and transmitted over the cable.  
   - The **transmitter** shifts the signal to a specific **frequency band** for efficient delivery.  

2. **Reception**:
   - The analog signal is received by one or more receivers connected to the cable.  

3. **Shared Access**:
   - Multiple end systems can send and receive data over the same coaxial cable.
